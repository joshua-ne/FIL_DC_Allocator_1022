# Filecoin Allocator Pathway

## Overview

This repository documents and supports the operational pathway of a **Filecoin Plus (Fil+) DataCap Allocator**. Its purpose is to provide transparency around allocation practices, ensure alignment with community governance standards, and foster a reliable process for onboarding valuable datasets to the Filecoin network.

Beyond allocation itself, this pathway also emphasizes **community support, peer learning, and practical dispute handling**, ensuring that decisions are not only transparent but also constructive and accountable.

The allocator pathway described here is part of the broader Fil+ governance framework, where Allocators serve as stewards of DataCap distribution. This process helps ensure that DataCap is used responsibly and exclusively for data with long-term utility.

## Community Governance and Compliance

All contributors, applicants, and stakeholders engaging through this repository are expected to adhere strictly to the community’s governance principles and operating rules. These include:

- **Transparency** in allocation requests and decisions.
- **Verifiability** of datasets, including provenance, structure, and authorization.
- **Compliance** with Fil+ guidelines regarding storage provider distribution and retrieval performance.
- **Accountability** for the careful and reasonable use of allocated DataCap.
- **Continuous monitoring** of allocations to ensure responsible and verifiable usage over time.

The allocator process is not only about distributing storage capacity, but also about ensuring that all data onboarded through Fil+ strengthens the trust and value of the Filecoin ecosystem.

* _As a special reminder, all applications are expected to provide complete index information and ensure effective data retrievability, in line with community requirements for verifiable access._

## Focus on Valuable Data Onboarding

The pathway prioritizes the onboarding of **valuable and meaningful data**. This includes:

- **Public datasets**, which can be accessed and retrieved by the broader community, such as open scientific, cultural, or civic data.
- **Enterprise datasets**, which may not be fully open but still represent high-value use cases, with clear provenance, authorization, and long-term storage needs.
- **Diverse data sources** across scientific, educational, enterprise, AI, and multimedia domains, broadening the scope of Filecoin’s long-term value.

By focusing on these categories, the pathway ensures that Filecoin continues to grow as a network that preserves content of enduring utility.

## Contribution and Collaboration

We welcome constructive collaboration with Clients, Storage Providers, and community members who share the goal of advancing Filecoin’s mission. Participation in this pathway should always aim to:

- Enhance the quality and reliability of data stored on the network.
- Strengthen compliance with governance and audit processes.
- Contribute to building a sustainable, trustworthy, and value-driven Filecoin ecosystem.
- Remain mindful of risks such as over-concentration or unverifiable data, and work collaboratively to reduce them.

## Community Support and Spirit

In line with the spirit of the Filecoin community, Clients are encouraged to seek advice not only from Allocators but also from other Clients who have gone through similar onboarding and allocation processes. Peer-to-peer consultation often provides practical insights, helps surface best practices, and reduces uncertainty in navigating governance requirements.

Allocators, while operating within the boundaries of their mandate, remain available to provide clarification, point to relevant governance materials, and share procedural guidance where appropriate. The intention is not to replace community-driven learning, but to complement it with structured oversight and ensure that all participants have a fair and accessible pathway to bring their data onto the Filecoin network.

By fostering both Client-to-Client dialogue and Allocator-to-Client support, the pathway reflects the collaborative ethos of the ecosystem—one where participants take shared responsibility for compliance, transparency, and the creation of long-term value.

## Dispute Handling Rules

From time to time, questions or disagreements may arise in relation to allocation requests, review outcomes, or ongoing monitoring. To address such matters constructively, the following principles are applied:

1. **Transparency of Discussion**
   - All substantive disputes are to be raised and tracked through public community channels (e.g., GitHub issues, governance forums).
2. **Evidence-Based Review**
   - Concerns should be supported by verifiable references such as on-chain records, dataset documentation, or previously published allocation notes.
3. **Iterative Clarification**
   - Where uncertainty exists, the Allocator may request additional information from the Client or Storage Providers. Disputes are often resolved by clarification rather than escalation.
4. **Community Alignment**
   - In cases where disagreement persists, the Allocator will defer to established Fil+ governance norms and community consensus.
5. **Proportional Response**
   - The pathway avoids overreaction to isolated or minor issues. Only repeated, material, or unresolved discrepancies may result in measures such as temporary suspension of allocations.

This approach is designed to remain simple and practical: disputes are made visible, examined with reference to evidence, and aligned with community governance, while allowing for flexible resolution without unnecessary complexity.

## Closing Note

This pathway is managed with professionalism and responsibility, but also with an open and collaborative spirit. We encourage all participants to engage constructively, uphold the highest standards of compliance, and work together to unlock the full potential of Filecoin as a decentralized data preservation network.

The pathway itself remains iterative, learning from each allocation cycle to refine practices without departing from established governance principles. Let us collectively ensure that every allocation brings lasting value to the community and beyond.
