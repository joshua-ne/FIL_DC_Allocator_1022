# Filecoin Allocator Pathway

## Overview

This repository documents and supports the operational pathway of a **Filecoin Plus (Fil+) DataCap Allocator**. Its purpose is to provide transparency around allocation practices, ensure alignment with community governance standards, and foster a reliable process for onboarding valuable datasets to the Filecoin network.

The allocator pathway described here is part of the broader Fil+ governance framework, where Allocators serve as stewards of DataCap distribution. This process helps ensure that DataCap is used responsibly and exclusively for data with long-term utility.

## Community Governance and Compliance

All contributors, applicants, and stakeholders engaging through this repository are expected to adhere strictly to the community’s governance principles and operating rules. These include:

- **Transparency** in allocation requests and decisions.
- **Verifiability** of datasets, including provenance, structure, and authorization.
- **Compliance** with Fil+ guidelines regarding storage provider distribution and retrieval performance.
- **Accountability** for the careful and reasonable use of allocated DataCap.

The allocator process is not only about distributing storage capacity, but also about ensuring that all data onboarded through Fil+ strengthens the trust and value of the Filecoin ecosystem.

## Focus on Valuable Data Onboarding

The pathway prioritizes the onboarding of **valuable and meaningful data**. This includes:

- **Public datasets**, which can be accessed and retrieved by the broader community, such as open scientific, cultural, or civic data.
- **Enterprise datasets**, which may not be fully open but still represent high-value use cases, with clear provenance, authorization, and long-term storage needs.

By focusing on these categories, the pathway ensures that Filecoin continues to grow as a network that preserves content of enduring utility.

## Contribution and Collaboration

- Enhance the quality and reliability of data stored on the network.
- Strengthen compliance with governance and audit processes.
- Contribute to building a sustainable, trustworthy, and value-driven Filecoin ecosystem.

## Closing Note

This pathway is managed with professionalism and responsibility, but also with an open and collaborative spirit. We encourage all participants to engage constructively, uphold the highest standards of compliance, and work together to unlock the full potential of Filecoin as a decentralized data preservation network.

Let us collectively ensure that every allocation brings lasting value to the community and beyond.
