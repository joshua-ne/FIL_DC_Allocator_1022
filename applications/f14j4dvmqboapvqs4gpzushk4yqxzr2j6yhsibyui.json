    "Brief history of your project and organization": "ChronoCore is a data-focused team committed to preserving, managing, and sharing high-value datasets. We work on indexing, storing, and enabling open access to scientific and benchmark datasets. As part of our mission, we leverage decentralized storage solutions like Filecoin to ensure data durability and global accessibility.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "This dataset is produced and maintained by the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC). It is a synthetic graph benchmark dataset, commonly known as the Social Network Benchmark (SNB) suite. SNB simulates the structure and operations of a social network, including user profiles, friendships, posts, comments, likes, and transactional behavior. It supports two workloads: the Interactive workload (for transactional graph queries) and the Business Intelligence (BI) workload (for analytical queries).",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Other",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://repository.surfsara.nl/datasets/cwi/lsqb/files/lsqb-merged/social-network-sf30-merged-fk.tar.zst",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03513598, Malaysia\nf03281237, Malaysia\nf03513633, Malaysia\nf03230423, Malaysia\nf01111110, Vietnam\nf01909705, Vietnam\nf02920450, Vietnam\nf03526821, Vietnam\nf03605143, United States\nf03604724, Japan",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
