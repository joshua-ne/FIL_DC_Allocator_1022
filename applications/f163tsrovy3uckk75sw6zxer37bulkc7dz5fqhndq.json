    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Data Skeleton is a specialized data preparation team focused on structuring, cleaning, and optimizing scientific datasets for research and machine learning applications. The team collaborates with academic and industry partners to ensure data integrity, accessibility, and analytical readiness. With expertise across domains, Data Skeleton bridges raw data and actionable insights.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Human Connectome Project (HCP) provides large-scale, high-quality neuroimaging datasets aimed at mapping human brain connectivity across the lifespan. Key datasets include HCP-Young Adult (YA), HCP-Development (D), HCP-Aging (A), and HCP-Baby (B), covering individuals from infancy to old age. These datasets include structural MRI, functional MRI (resting and task-based), diffusion imaging, and behavioral assessments. They serve as valuable resources for neuroscience, cognitive science, and brain development research.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/extensively-processed-fmri-data-documentation",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Permanently",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01422327, Japan\nf02252023, Japan\nf02252024, Japan\nf02920450, Vietnam\nf03526821, Vietnam\nf03230423, Malaysia\nf03281237, Malaysia\nf03513598, Malaysia\nf03513633, Malaysia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
