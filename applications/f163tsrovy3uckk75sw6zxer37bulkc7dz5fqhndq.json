With expertise across domains, Data Skeleton bridges raw data and actionable insights.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Human Connectome Project (HCP) provides large-scale, high-quality neuroimaging datasets aimed at mapping human brain connectivity across the lifespan. Key datasets include HCP-Young Adult (YA), HCP-Development (D), HCP-Aging (A), and HCP-Baby (B), covering individuals from infancy to old age. These datasets include structural MRI, functional MRI (resting and task-based), diffusion imaging, and behavioral assessments. They serve as valuable resources for neuroscience, cognitive science, and brain development research.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/extensively-processed-fmri-data-documentation",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Permanently",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01422327, Japan\nf02252023, Japan\nf02252024, Japan\nf02920450, Vietnam\nf03526821, Vietnam\nf03230423, Malaysia\nf03281237, Malaysia\nf03513598, Malaysia\nf03513633, Malaysia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
