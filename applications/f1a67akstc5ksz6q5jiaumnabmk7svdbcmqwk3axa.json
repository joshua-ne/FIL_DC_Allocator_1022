    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Byte Tunneling was founded in 2020 with a mission to facilitate open scientific research by preparing and managing large-scale datasets. With a background in handling high-energy physics data, Byte Tunneling has been trying to collaborate with global research institutions to prepare and organize public data.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "CERN Open Data is provided by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The datasets contain high-energy physics data collected from experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These datasets include raw and processed collision data, simulations, and supporting materials for educational and research purposes.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Other",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "A partner we met at a meetup provided tools that were re-engineered using components from IPFS.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://opendata.cern.ch/record/80030/files/assets/atlas/datascience/CERN-EP-2024-159/angular_000.h5.gz",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Permanently",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01422327, Japan\r\nf02252024, Japan\r\nf02252023, Japan\r\nf01111110, Vietnam\r\nf01909705, Vietnam\r\nf03215853, US\r\nf03218576, US\r\nf03230392, Vietnam\r\nf03230423, Malaysia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
