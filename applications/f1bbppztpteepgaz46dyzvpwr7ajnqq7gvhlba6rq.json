    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Xenogic is a team specializing in big data, active since 2022. We focus on exploring innovative commercial models in data collection, storage, processing, transfer, and application, aiming to harness the power of data in an era defined by AI and rapid technological advancements. With a commitment to redefining data-driven solutions, Xenogic strives to create impactful strategies that meet the evolving needs of modern businesses and industries, pushing the boundaries of how data can be utilized in a world of information and AI-driven transformation.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Kinetics datasets, developed by DeepMind, are large-scale collections of video clips designed for human action recognition research. They include various versions (e.g., Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Kinetics-700) and cover hundreds of human action categories, making them invaluable for training and evaluating AI models in video analysis and behavior understanding. Secure storage is essential to maintain data integrity, enable reproducibility in research, and protect the availability of this critical resource for future advancements in machine learning and computer vision.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Google Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The data is collected and made into car files by our homemade tool stacks, which have to proven to be accurate and efficient",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/train/part_0.tar.gz",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Permanently",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01422327, Japan\r\nf02252024, Japan\r\nf02252023, Japan\r\nf03230392, Vietnam\r\nf03230423, Malaysia\r\nf03232064, Malaysia\r\nf03232134, Malaysia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
