Game Operation Data: User login logs, server interaction data, game state storage, user progress, and historical records. The daily data volume reaches terabytes, with peak levels exceeding 5TB per day.\r\n2. User Behavior and Analytics Data: Records of player actions, device adaptation data, market feedback, and user preference analysis. The monthly storage demand exceeds 30TB and continues to grow.\r\n3. Multimedia Resource Data: High-quality game art assets, audio files, CG animations, and video data. The total data volume has already surpassed 500TB and is expected to increase further with the release of new games.",
