    "Brief history of your project and organization": "DataVoyager is a data engineering and curation group focused on preparing, validating, and structuring scientific and technical datasets for reliable long-term use. The team emphasizes quality, transparency, and reproducible workflows to ensure datasets can be efficiently integrated into decentralized storage and research ecosystems.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) is a globally recognized, curated resource of immune-gene polymorphisms, widely used in immunology, transplantation, infectious-disease studies, and population genetics. Its structured, versioned, and continuously updated data makes it a critical reference for biomedical research and algorithmic analysis. Storing IPD on Filecoin strengthens the network’s portfolio of high-value scientific datasets, enhances long-term retrieval relevance, and expands Filecoin’s role in supporting open, verifiable, and durable research data.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The data will be prepared using standard curation and formatting pipelines with common bioinformatics tools to ensure consistency and quality.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ipd/imgt/hla/hla_nuc.fasta",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01269519, USA\nf03711292, Vietnam\nf01989013, Malaysia\nf01989014, Malaysia\nf01989015, Malaysia\nf02105010, Malaysia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
