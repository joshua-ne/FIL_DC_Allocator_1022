    "Brief history of your project and organization": "About AstroSynapse\nAstroSynapse is a data organization dedicated to supporting scientific and research communities by curating and preserving valuable datasets. Our focus is on enabling open access, reproducibility, and long-term availability of benchmark and scientific data. By leveraging decentralized storage networks such as Filecoin, AstroSynapse ensures that critical datasets remain secure, distributed, and accessible to researchers worldwide.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "We are storing the Graph500 benchmark dataset on Filecoin.\nGraph500 is a well-known benchmark used to evaluate supercomputers on large-scale graph analytics tasks, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and single-source shortest path (SSSP). The dataset includes synthetic graph data generated using the Kronecker method at various scales, and is widely used in high-performance computing (HPC) research for testing and reproducibility.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Other",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "As the data preparer, AstroSynapse will retrieve the Graph500 benchmark datasets from their official sources. The files will be verified with checksums, organized by scale, and packaged into standardized archives (e.g., .tar.gz). Using open-source tools such as Python scripts and common Linux utilities, we will clean, structure, and split the data into suitable sizes. Finally, CAR files will be generated with the Lotus toolchain to enable efficient import and storage on the Filecoin network.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://networkrepository.com/graph500.php",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03605143, United States\nf03604724, Japan\nf03513598, Malaysia\nf03281237, Malaysia\nf03513633, Malaysia\nf03230423, Malaysia\nf02920450, Vietnam\nf03526821, Vietnam",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
