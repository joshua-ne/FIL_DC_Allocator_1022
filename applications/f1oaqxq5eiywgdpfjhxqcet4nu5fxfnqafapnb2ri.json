    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Grey Gear is a data-focused team dedicated to organizing, preparing, and validating large-scale scientific datasets. With experience in geospatial processing and data quality assurance, the team emphasizes reliability, precision, and efficiency in enabling open research and long-term storage.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Metabolomics Workbench is a public repository for metabolomics data, hosting thousands of studies with raw and processed data from mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. It provides metabolite measurements, sample metadata, and analysis results across various organisms and sample types, supporting reproducible research and data sharing.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Azure Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We will prepare the data by organizing it into structured datasets, verifying integrity, and converting files into standard formats using Python scripts and metadata management tools.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/StructureData.php?RegNo=68285",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02105010, Malaysia\nf01989013, Malaysia\nf01989014, Malaysia\nf01989015, Malaysia\nf01269519, USA\nf03711292, Vietnam",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
